# Discussion_forum_Udacity
This is an app for discussion forum of Udacity. Being a student of Android Developer Scholar track, we have to stay online on Forum, but the problem is that to access DIscussion Forum or K/A Discourse we have to have a laptop/pc or use Google chrome on phone. So, this application is based on Android platform and the motive is to provide direct access to the forum.
